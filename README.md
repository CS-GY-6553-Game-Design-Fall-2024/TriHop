## How to play:

1. Switching lanes depends on if your hold down on the space bar or not. Holding the space bar down keeps you on the left lane; letting go of the space bar keeps you on the right lane.
2. Hop between lanes via holding down or letting go of the space bar to avoid red obstacles that are approaching you down each lane. Try to survive for the whole journey.
3. If you hit any red obstacles, you will fail and must start again. Use the space bar key to start the game when in a menu.

This iteration of the game was built on _Unity3D ver. 2022.3.46f1_ with the _WebGL_ package installed. Simply download the repository and open the Unity project. Then, make sure to build the project using _WebGL_!
